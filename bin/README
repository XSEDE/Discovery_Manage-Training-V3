The warehouse database needs to store this query to gather training class information from the Poral DB.

UPDATE glue2.resource_v3_resourcev3catalog SET "CatalogAPIURL" = 'sql:SELECT t1.*,t3.* FROM portal.training_class AS t1,portal.training_class_session AS t2 LEFT JOIN portal.training_session_to_category AS t3 ON t2.id=t3.session_id WHERE t1.id=t2.training_class_id;' WHERE "ID" = 'urn:ogf:glue2:info.xsede.org:catalog:xsede.org:xdcdb_training_class';
